# Python Employee Management System
**Current version:** v2.0.0 <br>
 Simple command line python Employee management system that links to a mongo database. <br>
 Just a fun little project for me to learn more in python and mongo. <br>
 Probably not the most elegant code, but any input regarding
 bug fixing/optimization is appreciated.
